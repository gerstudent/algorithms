## About Me

I am Herman, computer science student from Kazan. In my free time I do sports programming and study algorithms.      

## Contributions are welcome!

The repository was written by a student and may contain some mistakes. I will be glad if you suggest a more efficient implementation of the algorithm or point out some errors in the code.
