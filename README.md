# Algorithms library

## Description

This repository is a summary of lectures from various programming courses and was created in order to systematize the material. It contains the most useful and frequently used algorithms. Most of the code is written in C++, but Python and Java implementation examples will also be added as I work.

## About Me

I am Herman, computer science student from Kazan. In my free time I do sports programming and study algorithms.      

## Contributions are welcome!

The repository was written by a student and may contain some flaws. I will be glad if you suggest a more efficient implementation of the algorithm or point out some errors in the code.
